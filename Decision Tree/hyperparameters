ereâ€™s an explanation of key hyperparameters for decision trees:

1. ccp_alpha (Cost-Complexity Pruning Alpha)
Controls post-pruning of the tree.
Higher values prune more branches, simplifying the tree but risking underfitting.
Lower values keep more branches, risking overfitting.
Default: 0.0 (no pruning).
  
2. max_leaf_nodes
Limits the maximum number of leaf nodes in the tree.
A smaller value results in a simpler tree, reducing overfitting.
Default: None (no limit).

3. criterion
Determines the function to measure the quality of splits:
"gini": (Default) Measures Gini impurity (for classification).
"entropy": Measures information gain (for classification).
"squared_error": Measures variance reduction (for regression).
"absolute_error": Measures mean absolute error (for regression).

4. max_depth
Sets the maximum depth of the tree.
Prevents the tree from growing too deep, controlling overfitting.
Default: None (tree grows until all leaves are pure or minimum samples split).

5. min_samples_split
The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
Higher values reduce splits, creating a simpler tree and reducing overfitting.
Default: 2.

6. min_samples_leaf
The minimum number of samples required in a leaf node.
Higher values prevent smaller splits, making the tree simpler.
Default: 1.
  
7. min_impurity_decrease
A node will split only if the impurity decrease is greater than or equal to this threshold.
Controls the minimum impurity reduction needed for a split.
Default: 0.0.
  
8. max_features
The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
None: Use all features.
Integer: Use the specified number of features.
"sqrt": Use the square root of the total features.
"log2": Use the logarithm (base 2) of the total features.
Default: None.
  
9. splitter
Controls how the splits are chosen:
"best": Chooses the best split based on the criterion.
"random": Chooses random splits (useful for randomized trees).
Default: "best".
  
Summary
Key Parameters for Controlling Overfitting: ccp_alpha, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf.
Key Parameters for Quality of Splits: criterion, splitter.
These hyperparameters allow for fine-tuning the decision tree based on dataset characteristics and requirements.
